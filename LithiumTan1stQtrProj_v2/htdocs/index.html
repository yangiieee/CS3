	What is MIMIKO ? It is a website all about the Genshin Impact character: Kokomi ! Why Kokomi, you may ask ? I've chosen her to be the main subject of my website because I think her character is so interesting and people should pay more attention to her <3 Fun fact: Kokomi's beta name was 'Mimi', but it was changed during release along with her initial design, want to know more? </div>
