			<li>I love Fu Hua's character because of how well written her story is.<br>To make it simple, she's immortal and used to have many friends. But because she is immortal, she also witnesses her friend's deaths, which is honestly quite sad, it's one of the reasons I like her story a lot.
			<li> Because she is too afraid too witness another friend's passing, she decided to become a "lonely bird".
                        <li>There is more to the story, but I recommend for you to read it yourself since it is quite the masterpiece. <br><h4>
