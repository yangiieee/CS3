		<li>Though Lixue isn't a main character like the other two characters I've mentioned, she still peaked my interest.
		<li>She was Fu Hua's Last student.
		<li>Her story is actually quite sad, to say the least.<br>During her time under Fu Hua, she always strived to impress her, like she was her own mother.She just wanted Fu Hua to be proud of her.
		<li>Even in her last moments, Fu Hua was watching over her.<h4>
