		<p><h4>This image is the cover photo of the album: Moonchild by Niki.<br>
		Though Niki has many wonderful albums, this album is my favorite because I love the visuals as the instrumentals used in the album<br>
                because it reminded me of one of my favorite cartoons when I was still young - Avatar: The Last Airbender.<br><h4>
